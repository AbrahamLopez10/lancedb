# Welcome to LanceDB's Documentation

LanceDB is an open-source, serverless, low-latency vector database for AI applications.

The key features of LanceDB include:

* Scale to billion+ vector-search all without managing servers.

* Combine attribute-based information with vectors and store them as a single source-of-truth.

* Zero-copy, automatic versioning, manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.
